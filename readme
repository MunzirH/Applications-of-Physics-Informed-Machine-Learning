This research focuses on developing a novel approach that integrates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with sparse identification of nonlinear dynamic systems (SINDy) to discover the governing equations from scarce and noisy data for nonlinear spatiotemporal systems. The goal is to explore the potential for closed-form model discovery in practical applications where large and accurate datasets are intractable to capture.
