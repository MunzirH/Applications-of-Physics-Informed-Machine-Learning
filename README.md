# üåå Applications of Physics-Informed Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Physics-Informed Machine Learning** repository, created during my research at the University of Washington! This collection of notebooks combines machine learning with physical laws to solve complex scientific and engineering problems, especially when data is sparse or noisy. By embedding physics directly into the learning process, PIML models achieve accurate, interpretable solutions that respect fundamental principles of physics. üåçüí°

## üåü Key Concepts and Highlights

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: These neural networks incorporate physical laws, such as conservation principles or known equations, directly into the loss function. By doing so, the model respects these laws during training, achieving both accuracy and physical meaning.
- **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)**: SINDy is a technique for deriving governing equations of dynamic systems from sparse and noisy data. It helps identify the simplest mathematical structure that fits the data, yielding concise and interpretable models.
- **Experimental Data Handling**: Many real-world physical systems produce sparse or noisy data, making them challenging for traditional models. This repository demonstrates preprocessing, normalizing, and visualizing experimental data, preparing it for use in machine learning models.
